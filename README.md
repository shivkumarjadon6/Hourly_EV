Machine Learning in Python: Step-By-Step Tutorial
(start here)
In this section, we are going to work through a small machine learning project end-to-end.

Here is an overview of what we are going to cover:

Installing the Python and SciPy platform.
Loading the dataset.
Summarizing the dataset.
Visualizing the dataset.
Evaluating some algorithms.
Making some predictions.
Take your time. Work through each step.

Try to type in the commands yourself or copy-and-paste the commands to speed things up.
