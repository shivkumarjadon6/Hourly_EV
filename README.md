Machine Learning in Python: Step-By-Step Tutorial
(start here)
In this section, we are going to work through a small machine learning project end-to-end.

Here is an overview of what we are going to cover:

Installing the Python and SciPy platform.
Loading the dataset.
Summarizing the dataset.
Visualizing the dataset.
Evaluating some algorithms.
Making some predictions.
Take your time. Work through each step.

Try to type in the commands yourself or copy-and-paste the commands to speed things up.

If you have any questions at all, please leave a comment at the bottom of the post.

## Usage
Install Python:
If you haven't already, install Python on your machine. You can download it from the official Python website.

Install Pandas:
Open a terminal or command prompt and install Pandas using the following command:

bash
Copy code

pip install pandas

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):
It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your project. Create one using:

bash
Copy code

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
